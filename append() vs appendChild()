appendChild:
It can only append one node at a time.
It only accepts a Node object.
If the node is already part of the DOM, appendChild will remove it first before appending it to the new location.
It's a method that's been around for a long time and is supported in all browsers, including Internet Explorer.
eg:
    let textNode = document.createTextNode('Hello');
    let div = document.createElement('div');
    div.appendChild(textNode); // Appends the text node to the div


append:
It can append multiple nodes and strings in a single call.
It accepts Node objects and also strings. If a string is passed, append will create a Text node and insert it.
Like appendChild, if a node is already part of the DOM, append will remove it first before appending it to the new location.
It's a newer method and is not supported in Internet Explorer.
eg:
    let div = document.createElement('div');
    div.append('Hello', ' ', 'World'); // Appends three nodes (two text nodes and a space) to the div
